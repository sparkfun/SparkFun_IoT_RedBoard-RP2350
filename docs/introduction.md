The IoT RedBoard - RP2350 combines the RP2350 microcontroller with the Raspberry Pi Radio Module 2 to provide a powerful and versatile wireless development platform in the Arduino R4 form factor. In this guide we'll cover how to connect the IoT RedBoard - RP2350 to a computer and how to progam it three development environments: Raspberry Pi Pico SDK, MicroPython, or Arduino.

This guide uses just the hardware present on the IoT RedBoard - RP2350 so in order to follow along with this tutorial you'll only need the following items:

* [IoT RedBoard - RP2350](https://www.sparkfun.com/sparkfun-iot-redboard-rp2350.html)
* [USB-C Cable](https://www.sparkfun.com/usb-a-to-usb-c-cable-1m-usb-2-0-flexible-silicone.html)

## Topics Covered

This document contains three main sections: **Quickstart Guide**, **Hardware** and **Software**. 

The Quickstart Guide assumes a working knowledge of how to use a development board and the required software to program them for your project's needs. It covers a quick assembly and then jumps right into getting the necessary software packages installed to start uploading code in just a few short minutes.

The Hardware page provides a detailed overview of the IoT RedBoard - RP2350 along with all the major components included on the board. Refer to this page for information on things like the RP2350, LEDs, pinout and solder jumpers.

The Software pages are split into each supported development environment along with a page that goes into detail on what the UF2 bootloader is and how to use it on the IoT RedBoard - RP2350. Each software page gives instructions on how to download install its respective development environment, any necessary support packages including board definitions and, where necessary, library packages.

## Resources and Support Documentation 

You'll find the board design files (KiCad files & schematic), relevant documentation (datasheets, white papers, etc.) and other helpful links in the **Resources**. Lastly, the **Support** section includes a Troubleshooting page that includes any helpful tips specific to this board as well as information on how to receive technical support from SparkFun.
