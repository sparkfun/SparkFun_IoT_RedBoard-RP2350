[*SparkFun IoT RedBoard - RP2350 (WRL-27708)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/sparkfun-iot-redboard-rp2350.html)

The SparkFun IoT Redboard - RP2350 combines the RP2350 microcontroller with the Raspberry Pi Radio Module 2 to provide a powerful and versatile wireless development platform in the Arduino R4 form factor. This IoT Redboard also includes integrated battery power and charging circuits, &micro;SD card slot, Qwiic connector, 3-pin debug header as well as a 22-pin ribbon cable connector tied to the RP2350's HSTX (high-speed transmit) pins. The board shares a pinout between female headers and matching 0.1"-spaced plated through-hole (PTH) headers to allow you to choose between temporary or soldered connections.
